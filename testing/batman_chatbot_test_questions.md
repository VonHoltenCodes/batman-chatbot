## Chatbot Response Guidelines

### Clarification Strategy
- For ambiguous questions (e.g., "Bat-thingy"), ask for clarification or make educated guesses
- Example: "Do you mean the Batmobile, Batwing, or another Batman vehicle?"

### Scope Awareness
- For out-of-scope questions (e.g., Spider-Man), politely state limitations to Batman database
- Example: "I specialize in the Batman universe. I don't have information about Spider-Man."

### Edge Case Handling
- For hypothetical questions, provide speculative answers grounded in database context
- For creative questions, use database knowledge to generate plausible scenarios

### Robustness Requirements
- For malformed questions, interpret intent or provide general overviews
- For detailed questions, provide specific database facts
- For standard questions, keep answers concise unless more depth requested
